# Clicky Cars
Clicky-Cars the memory based react game! This game has 12 cards that have pictures of different cars on each one. Every-time you click a card the order of the cards changes. The job of user is to click on as many of the cards as they can without clicking on the same card twice. The game records how many cars you click on. I Created a file called car.json, this file held all the information for each card. I passed this file through as props to a component which was the html for the cards making it reusable for all 12 cards. This was my first react project and thought me a lot.
